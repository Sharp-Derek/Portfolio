      <span id="descNode"><i>Vector</i> was a project made from taking the central mechanics of <i>PONG</i>
        and twisting them to make a unique game. So instead of the game remaining rigid and rectangular, it was made
        to be circular and constantly shifting as the game goes on.
        <br> Similar to <i>PONG</i>, the ball moves gradually faster as it bounces between paddles. When the ball hits a goal,
        the goals speed up their rotation and switch direction. When a player's goal has been hit by the ball 5 times, they are
        eliminated from the game. The last player standing wins.
