        <i>ECHO</i> is a top-down puzzle game inspired by <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> and <i>The Swapper</i>, and in it, you play as an adventurer stuck in a time loop,
        who must use both his past and present selves to solve puzzles and unlock doors.
        <br>To solve these puzzles, you must consider your moves very carefully, as both your present self and your past self, your "Echo", interact with objects at the same time,
        whether it be pushing statues, stepping on buttons, or flipping switches. If you flip a switch one way, your Echo will flip it the other way.
        If you pushed a statue to a place you previously were, then your Echo will push it out of its way. Your Echo will go anywhere you can, even
        through dangers that you might have avoided. But violet fog will destroy your Echo if it touches it, so be wary of where you walk.
        <br>The game features ten rooms, and at the end of the last room, your total play time is posted at the Game Over screen. Replay to get a better time!
